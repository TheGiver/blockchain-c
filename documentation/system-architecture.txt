Protocol:
    * Client Registration:
        When a client decides to open a wallet on the blockchain, they will be given both a public and a private key. 
        The idea of key generation is not yet clear and should be looked into.
        The client or the blockchain system will then share that client's public key with all nodes on the network. 

    * Requesting a transaction:
        When a client requests a transaction, the request gets authenticated on the blockchain using the client's public key.
